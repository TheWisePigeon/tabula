# Tabula


Tabula is your place to organize your tasks with ease.

## Name
Tabula means "board" in latin. And the Prima in front of it means "first". So Tabula | Prima is to point out that this is kind of the v1 of Tabula

## How to use
Tabula is very easy to use. I will add more features in the v2. Watch this video and feel free to join the discord and ask any questions.
